Notes
- Canonical ids are deterministic hashes; the same inputs will yield the same ids on re-runs.
- Normalization uses ASCII folding and whitespace cleanup for name fields; originals are preserved in source datasets.
- Future enhancements can join Slam/MCP rows exactly to expose point or shot keys per match.
